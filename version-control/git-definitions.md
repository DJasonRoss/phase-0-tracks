# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a method of organizing different versions
of the same code.  It is useful so that you may recall older
versions of code for troubleshooting as well as so that many
different people or teams can work on the same code at the 
same time.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is like an experimental beta of a project. 
You take the original code and add to it in this 
virtual playground and when it is correct or working
as you'd like, you can merge it with the master branch.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is the process of adding new finalized code to your branch.
You would likely describe what changes you've made or what new
features you've added in the commit message to help you keep track
of what was added when.


* What is a merge conflict?
 This conflict occurs when seperate branches have changed identical
 portions of the same file and then attemped to merge.
